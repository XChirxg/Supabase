## 📲 Notification Learning App

This app was created as a **learning project** to understand how the **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) notification system** works.

After installing the app, you can view the app’s **FCM token directly on your device**. Using this token, you can visit:

🔗 **https://xchirxg.web.app/Supabase/notification**

From there, you can send push notifications to the app using the FCM token.

If you have **another user’s FCM token**, you can also send **custom notifications** to their device.

> ⚠️ This project is intended **only for learning and testing purposes**.
